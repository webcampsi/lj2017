talk_title : Xdebug - It's easy, Mkay

talk_description :
There are times when you get suckered in
By var_dump and print_f to stdin
But its when you do these things too much
That you've become slow and must get back in touch
 You can do it It's all up to you-mmmmmkay
 With a little plan you can change your life tooo-day
 You dont have to spend your life var_dumping stuff
 Being made fun of because of that
 Follow my plan and very soon you will see-eeyy, its easy mmkay


 We'll demystify Xdebug, how does it work, how to set it up for local/remote debugging and how to use handy features like conditional breakpoints (for example, recursion debugging). P.S. Original song from South Park
