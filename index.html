						<h2>Session: Fight for digital privacy</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>We are slowly migrating to World 2.0, a digital world which means that we have a part of our lives online. We&#39;ve heard from Ed Snowden (and few more others) that governments and companies worldwide collect data from various sources, without us even knowing. So, why do we need to take care of privacy? &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong&#34; most of us would say, but are we missing the point?</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>Tips and tricks how to encrypt their devices, emails, how to browse securely, a bit of philosophy why privacy matters.</p>

						<h2>Session: Google Play is not the only one</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>Google Play is overcrowded with apps. It has become almost impossible to make a break for indie developers. There are many alternative app stores out there and developers shouldn&#39;t ignore them.  On the other hand, these stores are also a great point for everyone to find apps that aren&#39;t on Google Play. More than enough reasons to look closely at these stores. I placed our apps on a lot of other app stores from the very beginning, including ones in China and in Iran. I will talk about my experiences with these stores and how they performed.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>If they are Android developers they&#39;ll be able to know where else can they publish apps (to earn more) and what to expect there, which stores are definetely must have, If they are not Android developers but have Android devices they can find out where can they search for apps that might not be on Google Play and if they are not Android developers nor have Android devices ... well, they are beyond my reach :-)</p>

						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>I&#39;ve been in creative industries for almost 20 years. It&#39;s been beautiful so far, yet it had its tolls. One of the most pressing ones is depression. It keeps coming back. And it took me 20 years to realize it will keep coming back. How do I cope with that?</p>

						<h2>Session: How not to get eaten by bugs?</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>I will talk about software testing, what it is and why it can also be a stressful job. I will talk about how the average day of a tester looks like, how do we cooperate with all the demands from product owner, scrum master, designers, developers, customers, investors… On one hand developers don’t like us, because we find bugs and on the other hand, if they like us, then the end-users don’t and they blame us if something doesn’t work. It’s hard to please everybody. And of course, I will talk about the techniques that can make all these problems and dilemmas less stressful. I will talk about how I cope with all these, what I do at home (do I still have any energy left?) and how I still enjoy in software testing even if it is a stressful job.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>They will get the techniques how to cope with stress, how to manage all tasks and people as a software tester or any other person that is a part of a software development cycle. They will get the more detailed look at a life of a software tester, how to find their passion and what it looks like to do every day what you love.</p>

						<h2>Session: How to grow your team with your code</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>How does your team make decisions? Do you know what expectations each team member have during the development of a certain project? With the evolving craft of software development today, with so manny branches, whether is it mobile development or web development, building UI&#39;s or AI&#39;s, it&#39;s super difficult to find your mission and purpose in this sea of information. Same principles that we use to scale our projects, like talking about the stack we are going to use or roles that we are going to take, we can use to scale the culture of our team. The only difference between those two is that we continue to grow our team even when the projects are over. This talk is going to be about the importance of teamwork, why every opinion matters, how can we utilize code reviews, happy Friday talks or even simple conversations to further our company goals and make every person feels happy and satisfied.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>I hope to, at least, make each person think about where they stand in their professional life, and to raise awareness why the company culture is important. That way, they could question the relationship they have with their team members and think about what can be changed and what must be changed.</p>

						<h2>Session: Frontend development - how to start and what to learn</h2>

						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>I&#39;ll walk you through some of the basics, tell you where to start, what to learn, in what order, and how to make your life less confusing than it already is. We will not be doing any coding, just general understanding what is a front-end developer and what it&#39;s skill sets are.</p>

In other words, user-experience is part of our lives and it&#39;s not just designers job to make the world friendlier. Although, I will explain how design-driven solutions help our business, thinking, etc.</p>

						<h2>Session: Unleashing Potential While Relaxing The Mind</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>The company I work for (X-Team) employs several methods to keep their developers productive and, even more importantly happy and anything but burnt out. This goes from having staff members whose job is to keep morale and motivation up, to things like organizing staff meetups, and a whole in-company &#34;parallel RPG universe&#34; with developers taking on the roles of the heroes of the story, and much more. I would like to present an overview of these methods, so other companies and developers may also benefit from these tried and true approaches, which, at least in my experience, go incredibly far past anything offered in your typical firm, especially considering we&#39;re a 100% remote company.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>Employers will get numerous ideas for increasing employee productivity, morale, and sense of community and camaraderie, and employees themselves will see that even considering IT employees being relatively well taken care of as it is, there is a whole &#39;nother world out there, and will hopefully take these ideas, at least those, that are free or at least very affordable, to their employees for implementation. Basically, I&#39;ll try to provide several ingredients that, each on its own, can already produce results, but together foster an almost cult-like loyalty and sense of happiness - and I mean that in the most positive way possible.</p>

						<h2>Session: Battling complexity</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>Life is easy when the app is small. With time, it grows larger and complexity creeps in. In order to keep our sanity, we have to battle it. If you&#39;ve spent at least a few years working in the software industry you&#39;ve either worked on or heard of some large long-lived project where features are a pain to add and its developers fantasize about killing it and reimplementing it from scratch. At the center of Toptal&#39;s business there is a very large system running it. The set of requirements and their complexity has grown organically over more than 67,000 commits. Toptal&#39;s engineering team has worked hard to keep its complexity under control and I&#39;ll share practical advice that can be used to improve any size project without overengineering it while preparing it for the future at the same time.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>In the age of buzzwords I want to offer a toolbox that is a bit more level headed. There&#39;s no need to start the application by using the latest no-sql database with the latest web framework broken down into 20 microservices that are then all dockerized in order to be able to scale the codebase. In fact it will probably hurt you to start like that. What I want to do is highlight some of the programming best practices that I found in my experience to be either misunderstood or neglected that have a big effect on handling raising complexity of a project.</p>

						<h2>Session: Case Study: Use of JSONB in PostgreSQL</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>Recently PostgreSQL introduced the JSON and JSONB data types. At first, we ignored this news, we could not see how the JSON types could be of use to us. But then we used it once and then twice and then we almost went overboard with JSONs. This prompted us to stop, take a step back and analyze when a JSON type is useful and when it causes unnecessary hassle.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>How and when to use the JSON types. What the advantages and disadvantages are. And how to avoid falling into a JSON mania.</p>

						<h2>Session: Salvaging a project heavily burdened by technical debt</h2>
						<h5>Description:</h5>
						<p>Disorganized code that no one fully understands, changes that cause bugs in seemingly unrelated parts of the application, plus a constant sense of urgency on top of it - does it sound familiar? The answer, sadly, is often &#34;YES&#34;, and a project I currently work on was no exception just a year ago. Nevertheless, we managed to gradually turn the things around, and brought the project to a much healthier state. The talk will focus on strategies used to tackle what seemed to be an unapproachable problem - primarily on the technical (code) level, but with some management aspects as well.</p>
						<br>
						<h5>What will the audience get from this talk:</h5>
						<p>Concrete advice on the technical and organizational measures taken that proved successful, as well as a few examples of approaches that actually did not work well in practice, despite their initial appeal. Essentially a set of concrete suggestions that can be applied to any project, regardless of the tech stack used.</p>
